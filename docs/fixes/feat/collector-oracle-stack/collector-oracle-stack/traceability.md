## Final validation matrix

Validation environment: isolated temporary Python 3.14 environment for core tests and packaging. OCI deployment documentation recommends Python 3.9–3.11, matching Oracle's currently documented SDK support range.

- Collector suite: 75 passed.
- Repository-wide discovery: 75 passed.
- Build: `oracle_compliance_collector-0.1.0.tar.gz` and `oracle_compliance_collector-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` created.
- Wheel inspection: remediation catalog and both JSON schemas present.
- Offline generated bundle: valid against `evidence-bundle.schema.json`.
- OCI parent-specific signature tests: Functions, Boot Volumes, Logging Analytics, and Notifications passed.
- Coverage honesty: a service with no successful operation is skipped and never marked scanned.
- Independent re-audit: READY; AC-03, AC-04, AC-06, and prior security findings passed.
- Wrapper follow-up audit: READY; argument safety, resolution, validation, and exit propagation passed.
- Config-profile audit: READY; exact inventory, secret absence, read-only DB identities, OCI services/auth, section scope, placeholders, and documentation passed.
- Product-scope and deployment-category re-audit: READY; implemented OCI operations and all `On-premises`, `OCI`, and `Hybrid` profile paths match the documentation.
